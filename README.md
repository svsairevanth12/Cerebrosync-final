# Cerebrosync

Cerebrosync is designed to assist cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy by providing early detection and continuous monitoring of cognitive changes. The platform offers a series of scientifically validated cognitive assessments that patients can take regularly. These tests evaluate different cognitive functions like memory, attention, language skills, and problem-solving abilities, which are often affected by chemotherapy (commonly known as "chemo brain").

## How it Works
- **Memory Assessment**: Tests short-term and long-term memory.
- **Attention Test**: Evaluates concentration and focus.
- **Language Skills**: Measures verbal comprehension and expression.
- **Problem-Solving Tasks**: Assesses cognitive flexibility and reasoning.

Patients can take these assessments online, with results helping healthcare providers track cognitive health over time. By identifying early signs of cognitive decline, patients can receive interventions to mitigate the impact on their quality of life.

## Key Features
- **Proactive Care**: Focus on early detection of cognitive changes during chemotherapy treatment.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regular assessments ensure ongoing tracking of cognitive health.
- **User Privacy and Data Protection**: Commitment to protecting user data while providing scientific validity in assessments.

The ultimate goal is to improve patient well-being by addressing cognitive health early and supporting their long-term mental and emotional well-being throughout treatment.
